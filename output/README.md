This folder contains 5 model prediction results.

We use an accuracy metric to evaluate the performance of each model.

RUN evaluation.py to see the accuracy score for each model.

Please use the following command to run evaluation.py

'python3 evalutaion.py'

Due to the folder size limitation (upload to coursys), we only put all predictions on the test dataset in this folder.

These results may have a little different from the results in the report, since each time we train a CNN or RNN model it will give random results.
